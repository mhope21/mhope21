## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Marcia!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack project that allows teachers to sign up for resource kits to aid in social emotional learning for their students and foster inclusion for neurodivergent students in the classroom. I am building this project in Rails (a new language for me) and React. I recently was able to expand the functionality of this app with a team in the Code the Dream practicum. I am very passionate about this project and will continue to add improvements to it as I continue my journey.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on Rails. I really love the ease with which you can create a full-stack application. The Rails "magic" that everyone talks about is just that. I took one of my old Python applications and converted it to Rails in a couple of hours, and it performed so much better. I am eager to learn more about this amazing language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the future. I haven't started my goal of working on open-source yet, but I plan to in the near future.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my recent project, Project Aware. I have worked on it for several months, and I love to tell people about because I think the idea is so important.
